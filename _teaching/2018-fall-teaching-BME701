An Introduction to biomedical engineering.  The biological, chemical, electrical, and mechanical principles involved in the design and operation of medical devices and bioprocesses.  The engineering research themes of the School of Biomedical Engineering are emphasized: mechanical engineering, biomedical imaging, bioinstrumentation, biomedical technology (e.g. biophotonics and medical robotics)and neurotechnology

This is a team taught course.  I taught the section on Instrumentation and Microcontrollers.
