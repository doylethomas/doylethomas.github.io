Dr. Thomas E. Doyle is an Associate Professor in the <a href="https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/ece"> Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</a>, Faculty of Engineering, McMaster University.  Tom is Director of the <a href="https://ehealth.mcmaster.ca/"> McMaster eHealth Graduate Program</a>, a member of the <a href="https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/msbe"> McMaster School of Biomedical Engineering</a>, a faculty affiliate of the <a href="https://vectorinstitute.ai/"> Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence</a>.  Tom received his Doctorate of Engineering Science in the area of Machine Learning for Health Augmentation from Western University.  Technical research interests include biomedical signal processing, health informatics, human-computer interfacing (HCI), and machine learning / AI for the augmentation, rehabilitation, and enhancement of human attributes. Pedagogial research interests include liminal spaces in engineering and medical education.

Perhaps the best description of my research is derived from the term cybernetics, which was defined by Norbert Wiener as the study of communication and control in the animal and the machine. I believe that the focus of my work is best defined as cybranetics, or the study of communication and control between the animal and machine.
