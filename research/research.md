This course is about technical design and communication for engineers. Using solid modelling CAD, freehand
sketching, and simulation, the course will explore the design of common mechanisms, visualization, the reading
and creation of engineering drawings, and technical standards. The course ties these elements together in a group
dissect and design project.
